# Harpie Combo Hand Simulator by Alex Merza
The purpose of writing this code is to calculate how often a Harpie deck can summon Romulus and Combo into Simorgh plays from there.

The program uses a "Decklist" as an input and simulates X number of 5 card hands.
Decklist can be edited by adding/removing cards from the txt files however, this will only have an impact on the results if the card is featured in the code.
The program then checks if any of the combinations of cards that can combo are in the simulated hand.
It then returns the percentage of the simulated hands that successfully combo'd.


Alot of the functions in the code includes comments to explain what they mean.
Test cases have also been included, these are to check that the program still works if we make any changes to the code. 






*Shoutouts to Marcus Patel and Gabriel Netz for writing the framework of the code, Team Disciples for bringing this kind of deckbuilding to the forefront of the meta, and the Harpie Discord for helping brainstorm different tech options.
